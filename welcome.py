        The stock market continues to progress and its development has never stopped.
        Analysts and investors keep developing each segment of the industry and the whole stock market ecosystem.
        This tool, the StockMail Dashboard, is designed to allow viewers to journey into the world of stock ecosystems of some of the major companies,
        and compare their performance.

        The StockMail Dashboard is structured in multiple Pages that are accessible using the sidebar. Each of these Pages addresses a different segment of the stock market.
        Within each segment, you are able to filter your desired companies to narrow/expand the comparison.
        By selecting a single company, you can observe a deep dive into that particular network.

        The dashboard provides stock data information with graphs and news regarding the stock and company. It also includes a table for new users to analyze various metrics.
        Additionally, the StockMail Dashboard offers stock forecasts for up to 5 years, allowing users to make informed decisions based on predicted trends.
        
        All values for amounts, prices, and volumes are in U.S. dollars, however we provide a currency exchange for users to use in order to change the their desired currency.
